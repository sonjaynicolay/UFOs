## 1.	Overview of Project: 


The main purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Originally users were able to filter by date only. In addition to the date, users now are able to filter for the city, state, country, and shape, after the addition of a table.


## 2.	Results: 


Depending on the information users are looking for they would be able to search by all search fields or one search field for results. Each search result displays a date, location, duration, shape, and brief description of each reported/ recorded UFO sighting. Example: 
Search by City and State:
Search by State and Shape:



Search by State Only:

## 3.	Summary: 


In summary the new design is simple. With it being simple those who are really looking for details regarding the sightings are left with surface level knowledge of the occurrences. To improve upon the design here are a few suggestions:

•	Include urls to each sighting that lead to the research, data, possibly a map and images that are associated with each UFO sighting.
•	Presenting the form and layout in a bit more of an organized fashion, that is more user friendly.
